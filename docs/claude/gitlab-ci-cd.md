> Learn about integrating Claude Code into your development workflow with GitLab CI/CD

<Info>
  Claude Code for GitLab CI/CD is currently in beta. Features and functionality may evolve as we refine the experience.

  This integration is maintained by GitLab. For support, see the following [GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/573776).
</Info>

<Note>
  This integration is built on top of the [Claude Code CLI and SDK](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agent-sdk), enabling programmatic use of Claude in your CI/CD jobs and custom automation workflows.
</Note>

## Why use Claude Code with GitLab?

* **Instant MR creation**: Describe what you need, and Claude proposes a complete MR with changes and explanation
* **Automated implementation**: Turn issues into working code with a single command or mention
* **Project-aware**: Claude follows your `CLAUDE.md` guidelines and existing code patterns
* **Simple setup**: Add one job to `.gitlab-ci.yml` and a masked CI/CD variable
* **Enterprise-ready**: Choose Claude API, AWS Bedrock, or Google Vertex AI to meet data residency and procurement needs
* **Secure by default**: Runs in your GitLab runners with your branch protection and approvals

## How it works

Claude Code uses GitLab CI/CD to run AI tasks in isolated jobs and commit results back via MRs:

1. **Event-driven orchestration**: GitLab listens for your chosen triggers (for example, a comment that mentions `@claude` in an issue, MR, or review thread). The job collects context from the thread and repository, builds prompts from that input, and runs Claude Code.

2. **Provider abstraction**: Use the provider that fits your environment:
   * Claude API (SaaS)
   * AWS Bedrock (IAM-based access, cross-region options)
   * Google Vertex AI (GCP-native, Workload Identity Federation)

3. **Sandboxed execution**: Each interaction runs in a container with strict network and filesystem rules. Claude Code enforces workspace-scoped permissions to constrain writes. Every change flows through an MR so reviewers see the diff and approvals still apply.

Pick regional endpoints to reduce latency and meet data-sovereignty requirements while using existing cloud agreements.

## What can Claude do?

Claude Code enables powerful CI/CD workflows that transform how you work with code:

* Create and update MRs from issue descriptions or comments
* Analyze performance regressions and propose optimizations
* Implement features directly in a branch, then open an MR
* Fix bugs and regressions identified by tests or comments
* Respond to follow-up comments to iterate on requested changes

## Setup

### Quick setup

The fastest way to get started is to add a minimal job to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` and set your API key as a masked variable.

1. **Add a masked CI/CD variable**
   * Go to **Settings** → **CI/CD** → **Variables**
   * Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (masked, protected as needed)

2. **Add a Claude job to `.gitlab-ci.yml`**

```yaml  theme={null}
stages:
  - ai

claude:
  stage: ai
  image: node:24-alpine3.21
  # Adjust rules to fit how you want to trigger the job:
  # - manual runs
  # - merge request events
  # - web/API triggers when a comment contains '@claude'
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "web"'
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: fetch
  before_script:
    - apk update
    - apk add --no-cache git curl bash
    - npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
  script:
    # Optional: start a GitLab MCP server if your setup provides one
    - /bin/gitlab-mcp-server || true
    # Use AI_FLOW_* variables when invoking via web/API triggers with context payloads
    - echo "$AI_FLOW_INPUT for $AI_FLOW_CONTEXT on $AI_FLOW_EVENT"
    - >
      claude
      -p "${AI_FLOW_INPUT:-'Review this MR and implement the requested changes'}"
      --permission-mode acceptEdits
      --allowedTools "Bash(*) Read(*) Edit(*) Write(*) mcp__gitlab"
      --debug
```

After adding the job and your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` variable, test by running the job manually from **CI/CD** → **Pipelines**, or trigger it from an MR to let Claude propose updates in a branch and open an MR if needed.

<Note>
  To run on AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI instead of the Claude API, see the [Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI](#using-with-aws-bedrock--google-vertex-ai) section below for authentication and environment setup.
