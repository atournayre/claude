Meilisearch collects anonymized data from users in order to improve our product. This can be [deactivated at any time](#how-to-disable-data-collection), and any data that has already been collected can be [deleted on request](#how-to-delete-all-collected-data).

## What tools do we use to collect and visualize data?

We use [Segment](https://segment.com/), a platform for data collection and management, to collect usage data. We then feed that data into [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/), a tool for graphing and highlighting data, so that we can build visualizations according to our needs.

## What kind of data do we collect?

Our data collection is focused on the following categories:

* **System** metrics, such as the technical specs of the device running Meilisearch, the software version, and the OS
* **Performance** metrics, such as the success rate of search requests and the average latency
* **Usage** metrics, aimed at evaluating our newest features. These change with each new version

See below for the [complete list of metrics we currently collect](#exhaustive-list-of-all-collected-data).

**We will never:**

* Identify or track users
* Collect personal information such as IP addresses, email addresses, or website URLs
* Store data from documents added to a Meilisearch instance

## Why collect telemetry data?

We collect telemetry data for only two reasons: so that we can improve our product, and so that we can continue working on this project full-time.

In order to create a better product, we need reliable quantitative information. The data we collect helps us fix bugs, evaluate the success of features, and better understand our users' needs.

We also need to prove that people are actually using Meilisearch. Usage metrics help us justify our existence to investors so that we can keep this project alive.

## Why should you trust us?

**Don't trust us—hold us accountable.** We feel that it is understandable, and in fact wise
